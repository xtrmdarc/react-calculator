# React Calculator

> This is a basic  calculator built entirely using React. You can perform basic math operations such as + , - , /, x, %. In this project I had the chance to consolidate my knowledge about React, developing a real-world project for a fictional company called Math-magicians.

## Live Demo

[Live Demo Version](https://xtrmdarc-react-calculator.herokuapp.com/)

## Built With

- React
- JS
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.js

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
